OK, so there were already
L<a thousand solutions|https://metacpan.org/search?q=pod+html> for
converting pod to HTML, but I wasn't especially happy with any of
them. Things I wanted were:

=over

=item *

Clean-looking XHTML and/or HTML5 output.

=item *

Unicode support. â˜»

=item *

Good syntax highlighting for Perl code samples within the pod.

=item *

Links to L<metacpan.org|https://metacpan.org/> by default rather than
L<search.cpan.org|http://search.cpan.org/>.

=back

And so I've cobbled together a solution using L<Pod::Simple>, L<PPI::HTML>,
L<HTML::HTML5::Parser>, L<HTML::HTML5::Writer>, L<XML::LibXML::PrettyPrint>
and L<Moo>, and released it as L<TOBYINK::Pod::HTML>.

Here's the example from the synopsis section:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use TOBYINK::Pod::HTML;
    
    my $pod2html = "TOBYINK::Pod::HTML"->new(
        pretty             => 1,       # nicely indented HTML
        code_highlighting  => 1,       # use PPI::HTML
        code_line_numbers  => undef,
        code_styles        => {        # some CSS
            comment   => 'color:green',
            keyword   => 'font-weight:bold',
        }
    );
    
    print $pod2html->file_to_html(__FILE__);

There's a basic command-line script C<pod2html-tobyink> supplied with it.

Oh, and this blog post was

and
